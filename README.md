# Note App

## Purpose
A demonstration and practice for myself of the capabilities of using Slate JS, React and ANTD UI library. 

## Use
It is for taking notes. Simple, but with rich text editing and use of the vast features in Slate JS.

## Current Goals:
- Basic functionality
- Marks
- Blocks


## Future Goals:
- Saving of notes
  - Could use CRUD or REST. Not sure at this present time.
- Ability to tag others
- Create accounts
- Sharing with platforms like twitter, etc.
- Make it a PWA
- Use of a backend?
